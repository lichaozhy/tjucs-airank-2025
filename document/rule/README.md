# Embodied Arena Leaderboard Rules

The Embodied Arena Leaderboards select benchmarks with wide influence in the field of embodied intelligence, and evaluate influential models and academic frontier models at home and abroad to form the Leaderboards.

## Benchmark Source
- Influential academic benchmarks:
  - Embodied Question Answering Benchmarks:
    - OpenEQA, VSI-Bench, ScanQA (3D), etc.
  - Embodied Navigation Benchmarks:
    - EB-Navigation, HSSD, R2R, etc.
  - Embodied Task Planning Benchmarks:
    - ET-Plan-Bench, EB-Habitat, EB-ALFRED, etc.
## Model Type
- Influential Models
  - GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, Qwen-VL-Max, LLaVA-OneVision, InternVL3, VILA-1.5, etc.
- Academic frontier models
  - RoboBrain, RoboPoint, UniNavid, SpatialVLM, etc.
- Models willing to join (please write an email to ***@tju.edu.cn to apply to join the Leaderboards)
  - Please provide the weight link of Hugging Face or ModelScope.
  - Please provide the API URL link, and indicate the model version supporting the OpenAI protocol interface.
  (! Note: Please provide the key of the corresponding model to ***@tju.edu.cn)
## Evaluation Metric
During the evaluation phase, we select the corresponding evaluation metric based on the characteristics of the benchmark itself, which generally include the following types:

- Embodied Question Answering
  - Accuracy Based on Exact Matching
    - VSI-Bench, Where2Place, ERQA, etc.
  - Accuracy Based on Fuzzy Matching 
  	- Rule-based Metric (e.g., CIDEr, BELU, MRA)
    	- RoboVQA, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, etc.
  	- LLM-based Metric
      - OpenEQA, UniEQA, etc.
- Embodied Navigation
  - Success Rate
    - EB-Navigation, HSSD, R2R, etc.
- Embodied Task Planning
  - Success Rate
    - EB-ALFRED, EB-Habitat, ET-Plan-Bench, etc.
## Update Frequency
- The Leaderboards are updated once a month, and a snapshot of the results is taken on the first working day of each month, as the leaderboards of the previous month.

- Each manufacturer is only allowed to submit an evaluation application once a month. After receiving the evaluation application, it is generally updated within 7 working days
