## 📈 Evaluation Metric

Embodied Arena currently supports the following evaluation metrics based on the characteristics of three types of core embodied tasks:

- ✅ Embodied Question Answering
  - Accuracy Based on Exact Matching
    - VSI-Bench, Where2Place, ERQA, etc.
  - Accuracy Based on Fuzzy Matching
    - Rule-based Metric (e.g., CIDEr, BELU, MRA)
      - RoboVQA, Scan2Cap, ScanQA, etc.
    - LLM-based Metric
      - OpenEQA, UniEQA, etc.
- 🧭 Embodied Navigation
  - Success Rate
    - EB-Navigation, R2R, RxR etc.
- 🧠 Embodied Task Planning
  - Success Rate
    - EB-ALFRED, EB-Habitat, ET-Plan-Bench, etc.

## ⏰ Update Frequency

- The Leaderboards are updated once a month, and a snapshot of the results is taken on the first working day of each month, as the leaderboards of the previous month.
- Each manufacturer is only allowed to submit an evaluation application once a month. After receiving the evaluation application, it is generally updated within 7 working days.
