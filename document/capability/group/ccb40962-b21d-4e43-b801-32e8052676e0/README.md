Task planning refers to decomposing the task into a reasonable sequence of sub-steps based on task instructions and visual inputs. The specific descriptions of the five sub-capability dimensions are listed below:

- **Base Planning**: Planning capability for tasks where the instruction specifies object types.
- **Visual Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks where the instruction refers to objects using object properties, states, etc.
- **Spatial Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks with spatial constraints.
- **Temporal Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks with temporal constraints.
- **Knowledge Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks where the instruction refers to objects using object-related knowledge.
