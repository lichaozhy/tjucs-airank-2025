Embodied Task Planning refers to decomposing the task into a reasonable sequence of sub-steps based on task instructions and visual inputs, consisting of five fine-grained capability dimensions listed below:

- **Basic Planning**: Planning capability for tasks where the instruction specifies object types.
- **Visual Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks where the instruction refers to objects using object properties, states, etc.
- **Spatial Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks with spatial constraints.
- **Temporal Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks with temporal constraints.
- **Knowledge Reference Planning**: Planning capability for tasks where the instruction refers to objects using object-related knowledge.
