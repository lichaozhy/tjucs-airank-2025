Spatial perception refers to the basic perception of spatial information such as spatial relationships, distance, location, and size. The specific descriptions of the four sub-capability dimensions are listed below:
- **Spatial Relationship**: Spatial relationship perception capability that it requires the model to make judgements on spatial relationships based on visual inputs, such as ‘next to’, etc.
- **Spatial Distance**: Distance perception capability that it requires the model to make judgements on relative or absolute distances based on visual inputs, such as ‘closer’, ‘3 metres’, etc.
- **Spatial Localization**: Location perception capability that it requires the model to localize based on visual inputs, such as a ‘bounding box’, etc.
- **Spatial Size**:Size perception capability that it requires the model to make judgements on space size based on visual inputs, such as ‘size of this room’, etc.
