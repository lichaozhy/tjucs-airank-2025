Spatial Perception refers to the basic perception of spatial information such as spatial relationships, distance, location, and size, consisting of four fine-grained capability dimensions listed below:

- **Spatial Relationship**: make judgments on spatial relationships, e.g., ‘next to’, etc.
- **Spatial Distance**: make judgments on relative or absolute, e.g., ‘closer’, ‘3 meters’, etc.
- **Spatial Localization**: determine location, e.g., a ‘bounding box’, etc.
- **Spatial Size**: make judgments on space size, e.g., ‘size of this room’.
