Embodied reasoning refers to reasoning about object, spatial, etc., based on basic perception and knowledge. The specific descriptions of the five sub-capability dimensions are listed below:
- **Object Reasoning**: Object Reasoning capability that it requires the model to reason feasible actions on objects, comparative results of object properties, etc., based on object perception results.
- **Spatial Reasoning**: Spatial Reasoning capability that it requires the model to reason object accessibility, spatial inclusiveness, spatial imagination, etc., based on spatial perception results.
- **Temporal Reasoning**: Temporal Reasoning capability that it requires the model to reason the causes and consequences of  based on temporal perception results.
- **Knowledge Reasoning**: Knowledge Reasoning capability that it requires the model to reason physical dynamics based on prior knowledge and visual inputs.
- **Task Reasoning**: Task Reasoning capability that it requires the model to reason the type and location of task-related objects, task  progress, etc., based on visual inputs and task instruction.
