The benchmark view presents the ranking of models on each benchmark across all
three Embodied AI domains (Question Answering, Navigation, Task Planning), which
is convenient for academic researchers to quote and compare with in their
research works. This view covers 18+ carefully selected evaluation benchmarks
with broad academic influence, providing comprehensive coverage from 2D/3D
question answering to navigation and task planning, facilitating convenient and
transparent cross-benchmark analysis. Each benchmark maintains its original
evaluation metrics and scoring system. The overall leaderboard score is
calculated as the average performance across all benchmarks within each domain,
with equal weighting applied to all benchmarks. This approach ensures fair
comparison while preserving the integrity of established evaluation standards in
the embodied AI community.
