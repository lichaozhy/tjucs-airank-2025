The capability view presents the ranking of models against each embodied capability in the systematic taxonomy, providing an up-to-date overview of embodied capabilities of advanced models. Models are evaluated across seven core embodied capabilities: Object Perception, Spatial Perception, Temporal Perception, Embodied Knowledge, Embodied Reasoning, Embodied Navigation, and Embodied Task Planning, offering comprehensive assessment of model capability profiles with intuitive comparison for strategic insights into model strengths and weaknesses. Capability scores are calculated by aggregating performance across all benchmarks that evaluate each specific capability dimension, weighted by the number of evaluation questions/tasks within each capability. This benchmark-to-capability mapping is based on our systematic embodied capability taxonomy (detailed mapping available on the homepage), ensuring that capability scores accurately reflect model capabilities and comprehensive abilities in each core embodied intelligence dimension.
