- **`[2025/10/20]`** 📊 **We added an *evolved* benchmark to address the deficiency in existing benchmarks' evaluation of Temporal Perception.** `EA-Temporal-Auto-20251020` generated by *our LLM-driven automated generation pipeline* is now available for strengthening the evaluation of Temporal Perception! The [results](https://embodied-arena.beiyang.ren/#/leaderboard/09b4a56a-2e41-4103-a330-129381c24450/task) exhibit that Temporal Action Understanding (corresponding to the fine-grained embodied capability of Temporal Order) turns out to be very challenging to all the models.
- **`[2025/10/13]`** 🎯 **One new embodied navigation model joined Embodied Arena:** `InternVLA-N1` from [Shanghai AI Lab](https://github.com/InternRobotics/InternNav) is now available for benchmarking! It's in 1st place 🏆 on Embodied Navigation Leaderboard 🎉. [Check it out](https://embodied-arena.beiyang.ren/#/leaderboard/263e7d41-65a5-4b7b-8f48-5c7b94ca916b/task)!
- **`[2025/10/06]`** 🎯 **One new embodied model joined Embodied Arena:** `wall-oss-fast` from [X Square Robot](https://huggingface.co/x-square-robot/wall-oss-fast) is now available for benchmarking! [Check its results](https://embodied-arena.beiyang.ren/#/leaderboard/09b4a56a-2e41-4103-a330-129381c24450/task) on all the three leaderboards.
- **`[2025/10/01]`** 📬 **Three new benchmarks are joining Embodied Arena 📬:** [OST-Bench](https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/) (online spatio-temporal understanding) from Shanghai AI Laboratory, [MSQA](https://github.com/MSR3D/MSR3D) (multimodal situated reasoning), [MSNN](https://github.com/MSR3D/MSR3D) (next-step navigation) and [Beacon3D](https://github.com/beacon-3d/Beacon3D) (3D vision-language understanding) from BIGAI - currently in progress!
- **`[2025/09/18]`** 📄 Our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15273) of Embodied Arena is now **available on arXiv**. Check it out for more details 🔍!
- **`[2025/09/18]`** 🌐 We **launched** the [Official website](https://www.embodied-arena.com/) of Embodied Arena 🚀.
