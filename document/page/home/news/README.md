- **`[2026/1/17]`** 🌐 We **launched** the [Reports](https://www.embodied-arena.com/#/reports) ! This interface will continuously deliver concise evaluation results and discussions for subsequent benchmarks, providing systematic development insights and cutting-edge guidance for the embodied intelligence research community 🚀. 
- **`[2025/12/25]`** 🌐 We **launched** the [Benchmark Statistics](https://www.embodied-arena.com/#/statistics) ! This interface tracks the data distribution across all capability dimensions of the embodied AI benchmarks integrated into the platform in real time. Notably, the available evaluation data for temporal perception and embodied knowledge remains significantly deficient compared to other capability dimensions 🚀.
- **`[2025/12/15]`** 📊 **One new benchmark joined Embodied Arena**: [MSQA](https://msr3d.github.io/) from [BIGAI](https://www.bigai.ai/) is now available for the evaluation of situated QA with 3D grounding over text-formatted scene graphs and object images! Check out the evaluation [report](https://www.embodied-arena.com/#/reports/MSQA) for MSQA!  
- **`[2025/11/17]`** 📊 **One new benchmark joined Embodied Arena**: [OST-Bench](https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/) from [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/) is now available for the evaluation of multi-turn online spatio-temporal understanding!</li>
- **`[2025/11/03]`** 📊 **One new benchmark joined Embodied Arena**: [Beacon3D from BIGAI](https://beacon-3d.github.io) is now available for the evaluation of object-centric 3D vision-language understanding! Check out the evaluation [report](https://www.embodied-arena.com/#/reports/Beacon3D-QA(2D)) for Beacon3D!  
- **`[2025/10/20]`** 📊 **We added an _evolved_ benchmark to address the deficiency in existing benchmarks' evaluation of Temporal Perception.** `EA-Temporal-Auto-20251020` generated by _our LLM-driven automated generation pipeline_ is now available for strengthening the evaluation of Temporal Perception! The [results](https://embodied-arena.beiyang.ren/#/leaderboard/09b4a56a-2e41-4103-a330-129381c24450/task) exhibit that Temporal Action Understanding (corresponding to the fine-grained embodied capability of Temporal Order) turns out to be very challenging to all the models.
- **`[2025/10/13]`** 🎯 **One new embodied navigation model joined Embodied Arena:** `InternVLA-N1` from [Shanghai AI Lab](https://github.com/InternRobotics/InternNav) is now available for benchmarking! It's **in 1st place** 🏆 on Embodied Navigation Leaderboard 🎉. [Check it out](https://embodied-arena.beiyang.ren/#/leaderboard/263e7d41-65a5-4b7b-8f48-5c7b94ca916b/task)!
- **`[2025/10/06]`** 🎯 **One new embodied model joined Embodied Arena:** `wall-oss-fast` from [X Square Robot](https://huggingface.co/x-square-robot/wall-oss-fast) is now available for benchmarking! [Check its results](https://embodied-arena.beiyang.ren/#/leaderboard/09b4a56a-2e41-4103-a330-129381c24450/task) on all the three leaderboards.
- **`[2025/10/01]`** 📬 **Three new benchmarks are joining Embodied Arena:** [OST-Bench](https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/) (online spatio-temporal understanding) from [Shanghai AI Laboratory](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), [MSQA](https://github.com/MSR3D/MSR3D) (multimodal situated reasoning), [MSNN](https://github.com/MSR3D/MSR3D) (next-step navigation) and [Beacon3D](https://github.com/beacon-3d/Beacon3D) (3D vision-language understanding) from [BIGAI](https://www.bigai.ai/) are all currently in progress!
- **`[2025/09/18]`** 📄 Our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15273) of Embodied Arena is now **available on arXiv**. Check it out for more details 🔍!
- **`[2025/09/18]`** 🌐 We **launched** the [Official website](https://www.embodied-arena.com/) of Embodied Arena 🚀.
