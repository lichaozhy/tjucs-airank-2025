On the HM3D and MP3D datasets, Embodied Arena compare multiple customized evaluation frameworks and achieve quantitative analysis of different frameworks in terms of object navigation performance.
On the EB-Navigation dataset, Embodied Arena use the EmbodiedBench framework for flexible base model replacement to quantify object navigation performance of different models.
On the R2R-CE and RxR-CE datasets, Embodied Arena use an end-to-end (E2E) model evaluation framework for flexible model replacement to quantify visual language navigation performance of different models.
