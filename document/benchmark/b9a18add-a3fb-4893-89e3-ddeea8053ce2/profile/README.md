MineAnyBuild, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the
spatial planning abilities of open-world AI agents in Minecraft, requires
them to generate building plans from multi-modal instructions. It includes
4,000 curated tasks and supports scalable data collection through
player-generated content, evaluating spatial understanding, reasoning,
creativity, and commonsense. The evaluation reveals significant limitations
but also great potential in current MLLM-based agents, highlighting the
importance of MineAnyBuild for advancing spatial intelligence in AI.
