COMMENT: UniEQA, a new unified evaluation benchmark for embodied artificial intelligence,
is designed to evaluate MLLMs in terms of 5 core capabilities with 12 detailed
dimensions. The benchmark is established based on seven heterogeneous data
sources, covering simulated and real-world scenarios. The benchmark contains a
total of 5378 question-answer pairs, of which 4445 are completely different
questions format. By integrating multiple existing EQA benchmarks with newly
annotated datasets and performing manual review, UniEQA effectively ensures its
reliability, comprehensiveness and diversity.
