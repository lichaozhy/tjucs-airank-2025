ScanRefer is a benchmark for 3D object localization using natural language descriptions in RGB-D scans. The task challenges models to identify and localize a target object in a 3D point cloud based solely on a free-form textual description. Unlike traditional object detection tasks, ScanRefer requires grounding language in 3D space, capturing both object semantics and spatial context. The benchmark is built on a large-scale dataset comprising 51,583 natural language expressions referring to 11,046 objects across 800 indoor scenes from ScanNet, making it the first extensive resource for studying language-driven object localization directly in 3D environments.
