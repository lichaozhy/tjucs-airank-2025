EB-Navigation is the navigation-focused benchmark within
EmbodiedBench, designed to evaluate the low-level perception, grounding, and
action prediction capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
It is built on AI2-THOR environments with tasks derived from the VLN-CE
(Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments) protocol, but
restructured to use step-wise high-level commands.
