VLN-CE RxR is a dataset of human-annotated navigation
instructions in English, Hindi and Telugu, matched to navigation paths
through reconstructed buildings from the Matterport3D dataset. Compared to
similar datasets, VLN-CE RxR is multilingual and an order of magnitude
larger, and every instruction is validated by a separate annotator.
urthermore, each word in each instruction is time-aligned to the virtual
poses of instruction creators and validators. VLN-CE RxR dataset contains
instructions of fine granularity that describe rich landmarks and longer
trajectories, which establishes a large language and visual gap that is
suitable for evaluating the generalization potential of the methods.
