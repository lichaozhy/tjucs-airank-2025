COMMENT: EB-ALFRED is a high-level embodied planning benchmark introduced in
EmbodiedBench, built on top of the ALFRED dataset and AI2-THOR simulator. Unlike
traditional embodied settings that require pixel-level control, EB-ALFRED
abstracts away low-level actions and focuses solely on symbolic high-level
planning with language and vision input.
