OpenEQA is the first open-vocabulary benchmark dataset for EQA
supporting both episodic memory and active exploration use cases. OpenEQA
contains over 1600 high-quality human generated questions drawn from over 180
real-world environments. OpenEQA stands out as a straightforward, measurable,
and practically relevant benchmark that poses a considerable challenge to
current generation of AI models.
