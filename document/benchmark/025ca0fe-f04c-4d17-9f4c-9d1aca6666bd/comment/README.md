COMMENT: VLN-CE R2R dataset consists of 4475 trajectories. For each
trajectory, R2R-CE provides the multiple natural language instructions from
R2R and a pre-computed shortest path following the waypoints via low-level
actions. The low-level action space of R2R-CE makes trajectories
significantly longer horizon tasks â€“ with an average of 55.88 steps
compared to the 4-6 in R2R.
