SQA3D is a benchmark designed for embodied scene understanding,
aiming to bridge the gap between 3D scene comprehension and embodied AI. In
the SQA3D task, the tested agent must first comprehend its situation within
a 3D environment—such as position and orientation—based on a textual
description. It then reasons about the surrounding scene and answers a
corresponding question. The benchmark is constructed using 650 scenes from
the ScanNet dataset, encompassing approximately 6.8k unique situations. It
includes 20.4k textual descriptions and 33.4k diverse reasoning questions
tailored to these situations. These questions evaluate a broad spectrum of
reasoning capabilities in intelligent agents, including spatial
understanding, commonsense reasoning, navigation, and multi-hop inference.
