COMMENT: VABench, a challenging benchmark with 300 manually annotated problems from
real-world and simulation datasets (OXE, BridgeData, Droid). VABench evaluates
models' abilities to generate spatial affordance and visual traces from natural
language instructions, using metrics including point accuracy, trajectory
MAE/RMSE, and GPT-based qualitative scoring.
