Multi3DRefer is a benchmark that extends 3D visual grounding to the task of localizing a flexible number of objects in real-world 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions. Unlike previous tasks that focus on identifying a single unique object, Multi3DRefer reflects more realistic scenarios where descriptions may refer to zero, one, or multiple objects simultaneouslyâ€”an important capability for applications like robotic navigation and manipulation. Built upon and generalizing the ScanRefer dataset, Multi3DRefer contains over 61,900 descriptions referencing more than 11,600 objects, accompanied by a new evaluation metric tailored for multi-object localization. This benchmark provides a comprehensive platform for advancing multi-modal 3D scene understanding in complex, real-world environments.
