PhyBlock, a progressive benchmark designed to assess VLMs on
physical understanding and planning through robotic 3D block assembly tasks.
PhyBlock integrates a novel four-level cognitive hierarchy assembly task
alongside targeted Visual Question Answering (VQA) samples, collectively
aimed at evaluating progressive spatial reasoning and fundamental physical
comprehension, including object properties, spatial relationships, and
holistic scene understanding. PhyBlock includes 2600 block tasks (400
assembly tasks, 2200 VQA tasks) and evaluates models across three key
dimensions: partial completion, failure diagnosis, and planning robustness.
