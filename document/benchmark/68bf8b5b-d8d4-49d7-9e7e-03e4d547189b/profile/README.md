The ET-Plan-Bench focuses on various aspects of spatial
understanding, including relation constraints, object occlusion, and global
layout maps, as well as temporal understanding, covering action dependencies
and optimal moving paths for robots. It provides a detailed and thorough
diagnostic assessment of existing foundation models.
