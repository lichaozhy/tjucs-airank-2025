## Benchmark Introduction

![alt text](assets/1-1.png)

The ET-Plan-Bench focuses on various aspects of spatial understanding, including relation constraints, object occlusion, and global layout maps, as well as temporal understanding, covering action dependencies and optimal moving paths for robots. It provides a detailed and thorough diagnostic assessment of existing foundation models.
