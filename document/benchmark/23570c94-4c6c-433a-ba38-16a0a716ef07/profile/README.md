Cosmos Embodied Reasoning Benchmark is specifically designed to evaluate the capability of multimodal models to assist agents in perception, reasoning, and decision-making through the observation of embodied task videos. The evaluation suite comprises five diverse subtasks: BridgeV2, RoboVQA, AgibotWorld, HoloAssist, and RoboFail, totaling 510 meticulously curated and manually designed question-answer pairs that challenge a model's ability to ground its reasoning in the physical world.
