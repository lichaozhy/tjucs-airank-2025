COMMENT: OST-Bench is a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the **O**nline **S**patio-**T**emporal scene understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) from the perspective of an embodied agent dynamically exploring a static indoor environment. In contrast to conventional offline settings that answer questions based on a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, OST-Bench's "Online" aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations. The "Spatio-Temporal" component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes.
