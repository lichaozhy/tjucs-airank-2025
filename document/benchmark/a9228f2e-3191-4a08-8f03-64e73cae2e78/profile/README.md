Where2Place is a benchmark for spatial free-space reference
on challenging real world images This dataset contains 100 real-world images
to evaluate free space reference using spatial relations. The images are
collected from various cluttered environments. Each image is labeled with a
sentence describing the desired some free space and a mask of the desired
region.
