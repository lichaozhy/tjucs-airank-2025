The Matterport3D (MP3D) dataset provides high-fidelity, photorealistic scans of real-world indoor environments. It contains a diverse set of 90+ buildings including homes, offices, and churches. The ObjectNav benchmark on MP3D evaluates an agent’s ability to generalize object search strategies across these complex layouts, with limited prior information about the target’s location. MP3D presents challenges such as long-range navigation, occlusions, and diverse room layouts. Agents are tested in unseen environments to assess their generalization capabilities, with metrics like Success Rate (SR) and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL).
