COMMENT: EB-Habitat is the 3D embodied navigation benchmark in
EmbodiedBench, built on the HM3D dataset and executed in the Habitat 2.0
simulator. It evaluates an agentâ€™s ability to perform long-horizon
goal-directed navigation using only egocentric vision and natural language
instructions, without access to ground-truth maps or GPS.
